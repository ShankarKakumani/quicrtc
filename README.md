# QuicRTC

üöß **Work in Progress** üöß

A next-generation real-time communication library built in Rust, leveraging QUIC transport with Media over QUIC (MoQ) protocol for ultra-low latency media streaming.

## Current Status

This project is actively under development. Core transport and basic media functionality are implemented and functional. We're currently working on advanced features and platform-specific optimizations.
